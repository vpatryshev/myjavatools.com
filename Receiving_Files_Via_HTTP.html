  <title>Receiving Files Via HTTP</title>
</head>
<body>
In my previous article I wrote about sending HTTP requests with form
data, including files from Java. Now I would like to talk about the
other end of the line: how to handle form data, including multipart,
including files, on the server side. I will use the three examples from
that article, <a href="http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/17679/0/page/1">http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/17679/0/page/1</a>,
to demonstrate my point.<br>
Usually people would expect a
servlet to process multipart requests, since it is too much for a JSP
to handle. But with a properly designed decorator class for
HttpServletRequest you can actually handle anything right inside your
jsp. <br>
<br>
For instance, when you, in your jsp, extract request information the
first two requests, <code> &lt;form method="get"
action="hi.iq/register.jsp"&gt; Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name"
value="J.Doe"&gt; email: &lt;input type="text" name="email"
value="abuse@spamcop.com"&gt; &lt;input type="submit"&gt; &lt;/form&gt;
</code><br>
and <code> &lt;form method="post" action="hi.iq/register.jsp"&gt;
Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name" value="J.Doe"&gt; email:
&lt;input type="text" name="email" value="abuse@spamcop.com"&gt;
&lt;input type="submit"&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code> from that article,
you do not need any decorator, since the request, represented in in
your jsp by <code>request</code>, an instance of class <code>javax.servlet.HttpServletRequest</code>,
handles both GET and POST, so that you can conveniently extract the
values of form fields <code>name</code>
and <code>email</code> using <code>request.getParameter("name")</code>
and
<code>request.getParameter("email")</code>.<br>
It is very different with multipart request.
