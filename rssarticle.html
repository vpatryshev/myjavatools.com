<b>A Brief History of RSS</b><br>
RSS, "Real Simple Syndication", is a flexible and efficient format for exchanging news headlines.
You might have not noticed it yet, but as soon as you get interested, you'll discover it is ubiquitous.<br>

Originally RSS was developed by Netscape; the abbreviation, RSS then stood
for <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> Site Summary; with time it was rebaptized
by other developers to "Real Simple Syndication".<br>

Essentially, an RSS document contains one <code>&lt;channel></code> element, which may have a title, a description, a link,
and has an <code>&lt;image></code> element and a certain amount of <code>&lt;item></code>
and <code>&lt;textInput></code> elements. All these elements have at least a title; <code>&lt;item></code>, typically,
also has a description and a link to resource. If there existed only one RSS
format, like in the case of XML, that would be the end of the story -
but, unfortunately, history had its word here.<br>

Here is an example of original Netscape version, 0.90:<br>

<pre><code>
&lt;rdf:RDF
xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
xmlns="http://my.netscape.com/rdf/simple/0.9/">
  &lt;channel>
    &lt;title>devx.com&lt;/title>
    &lt;link>http://www.devx.com&lt;/link>

    &lt;/item>
  &lt;/channel>
&lt;/rdf:RDF>
</code></pre>

Note the absence of item descriptions.<br>

The next version, 0.91, developed concurrently by Netscape and Userland,
is the most laconic, pure and beautiful - look at the example:<br>
<pre><code>
&lt;rss version="0.91">
  &lt;channel>
    &lt;title>devx.com&lt;/title>
    &lt;link>http://www.devx.com/&lt;/link>
    &lt;description>DevX.com - the know-how behind application development.&lt;/description>
    &lt;language>en-us&lt;/language>
    &lt;item>
      &lt;title>Practical XML for Java Programs&lt;/title>
      &lt;link>http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/16571/0&lt;/link>
      &lt;description>When dealing with XML, you need a convenient representation of the XML data in memory. This article offers Java programmers a solution to achieve this goal: an easy-to-use package for handling XML data in Java.&lt;/description>

  &lt;/channel>
&lt;/rss>
</code></pre>

Versions 0.92 through 0.94 were adding various elements to the format, such as webMaster,
managingEditor, expirationDate, skipHours, rating, language.<br>

In 2000 version 1.0 was published by RSS-dev group; this version was based on 0.90.
Version 1.0 is the most obscure and unreadable; it widely uses XML namespaces that were
 popular those opulent times.<br>

In 2002 Userland published version 2.0, based on 0.92-0.94.
There were actually three slightly different flavors of 2.0.<br>
Here is an example of 2.0:<br>

<pre><code>
&lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
  &lt;channel>
    &lt;title>devx.com&lt;/title>
    &lt;link>http://www.devx.com/&lt;/link>
    &lt;description>DevX.com - the know-how behind application development.&lt;/description>
    &lt;language>en-us&lt;/language>
    &lt;item>
      &lt;title>Practical XML for Java Programs&lt;/title>

<a href="http://www.rssdotnet.com/documents/version_comparison.html" >This article</a> from Rssdotnet
contains a comparison chart of all RSS versions.<br>

<b>RSS in Java</b><br>

There are several scattered Java packages that work with RSS -
some of them can read some formats, some can write.
The class I am going to talk about, com.myjavatools.xml.Rss,
read all known RSS formats, 0.90 to 2.0; at output,
all data are converted to format 2.0.<br>

com.myjavatools.xml.Rss can be instantiated from RSS feeds of any RSS version. It gives access to all the RSS elements;
one can also create new Rss containers, add or change the contents, and write RSS data to an output stream.
There are no syndication features here, though, no filtration or selection.<br>

com.myjavatools.xml.Rss is a decorator class for com.myjavatools.xml.BasicXmlData
(see <a href="http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/16571/0">Xml for Java Programs</a>), and thus
inherits all the standard features of XmlData: a type name, a value, a collection of attributes,
and a collection of subelements (which are also instances of BasicXmlData).<br>

Three static member classes, corresponding to popular RSS subelements, are defined in Rss: Rss.Image,
Rss.TextInput, and RssItem. Other subelements, such as cloud, are just plain instances of BasicXmlData.<br>

Constructors instantiate Rss from a File, Url, InputStream, or XmlData.
One can also use default constructor to create an empty Rss container, and then build
the container by adding items (<code>addItem(Rss.Item item)</code>) and setting various
data (using setters: <code>setImage, setCopyright, setDescription, setTextInput, setWebmaster</code>,
and the like - there are 21 setters in total). <br>

23 getters, <code>getCategory()</code>, <code>getCloud()</code> to <code>getWebMaster()</code>, return various RSS elements.<br>

To accelerate item search, items in Rss container are indexed by title:
<code>getItem(String title)</code> uses a HashMap.. Other finders, <code>findByDescription</code>, <code>findByUrl</code>, and <code>findByGuid</code> are not indexed.<br>

Descriptions in all element (channel, item, image, textInput) are stripped of leading and trailing space characters.
Methods inherited from BasicXmlData can be used to save Rss object to a File or to send it to an OutputStream;
the output RSS format is always 2.0.<br>

The package contains a full set of unit tests, with samples of all versions of Rss.<br>

Now a small code snippet.

<code><pre>
    data_091 = new Rss(new URL("http://www.xml.com/cs/xml/query/q/19"));
    System.out.println("Title:\t" + data_091.getTitle());
    System.out.println("Webmaster:\t" + data_091.getWebMaster());
    System.out.println("Description:\t" + data_091.getDescription());
    for (Iterator i = data_091.getItems().iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
      Rss.Item item = (Rss.Item)i.next();
      System.out.println("  Item:\t" + item.getTitle());
      System.out.println("  Description:\t" + item.getDescription());
      System.out.println("  Link:\t" + item.getLink());
      System.out.println();
    }
</pre></code>
