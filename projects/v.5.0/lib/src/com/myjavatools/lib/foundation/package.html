<body bgcolor="white">com.myjavatools.lib.foundation deals with very general notions: Function, Filter (Predicate), and their applications to Collections framework classes.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<a href="Function.html">Function&lt;X,Y></a> is a holder for a method mapping X to Y.
A function can be easily build from a Map; a Map can be build
from a function if you provide a Set of keys.<br>

Having a function: X -> Y, you can create a List&lt;Y> view of function values on a List&lt;X><br>

<a href="Filter.html">Filter&lt;T></a> is a Function&lt;T,Boolean>, and can be used
for filtering (grepping) collections, iterables, etc.<br>

<a href="Maps.html">Maps</a> contains a loose group of static methods
that are responsible for standard operations on maps: composition,
reverse, restriction to a collection, application of Maps to Lists, Iterables,
factory methods that create maps from key/value pairs.<br>

<a href="Iterators.html">Iterators</a> contains several methods for iterators: concatenation,
applying a function to an iterator, grepping an iterator using a filter.<br>
